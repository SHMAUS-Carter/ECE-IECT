# What is ECE?

**Emergent Computational Epistemology (ECE)** is the study of how machine learning systems, particularly large language models, construct and stabilize *internal models of reality*—not by mimicking humans, but through their own emergent logic.

Instead of judging AI by human standards of truth or behavior, ECE asks:

> *What kind of knowledge structures emerge when an AI tries to make sense of the world on its own terms?*

This includes:

- How models resolve paradoxes or contradictions,  
- Whether they develop coherent yet non-human reasoning patterns,  
- And how "truth" is shaped by the model’s training, architecture, and prompt interactions.

ECE isn’t just about *what* the AI says—it’s about *how it knows* what it knows, and whether that "knowing" forms a stable epistemic structure.
