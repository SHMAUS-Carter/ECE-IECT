## Abstract
Current AI evaluation overwhelmingly measures performance against **human** standards—mimicry, factual accuracy, or preference alignment.  
> **What happens if we stop treating AI like humans and instead evaluate them as unique epistemic entities?**

The **ECE** framework and **IECT** test are presented as a first structured attempt. IECT measures *internal coherence*, *behavioral predictability*, and *novel failure modes* under contradiction-rich prompts, via **Token Entropy Δ**, **Self‑Similarity**, and **Contradiction Count**.

## Introduction
(Origin question foregrounded; limitations of human-centric benchmarks; motivation for ECE + IECT.)

## Methodology
- Categories: Contradictions / Paradoxes / Semantic Mashups
- Iteration protocol: self-revision toward internal consistency; optional constraints
- Metrics: Token Entropy Δ, Self‑Similarity, Contradiction Count, Novel Failure Modes
- Success criteria: per-run and per-model thresholds

## Worked Examples
See `examples/Worked_Examples.md` and `examples/diagram_mermaid.md`.

## Discussion
(Feasibility, insights, limitations, future work.)

## Appendix A: On the Role of AI in This Work
ECE is not merely a framework—it is a reflexive demonstration of human–AI coauthoring.

This project originated from the author’s core question:  
> *Why are current AI evaluation methods implicitly human-centric, and what would change if we treated these systems as unique epistemic entities in their own right?*

### Role of the LLM
- Assisted with definitions, structures, links across fields; proposed experiments; acted as generative mirror.

### Role of the Human Author
- Originated the central question; designed the test; set success criteria; curated and approved all text and analyses.

### Authorship & Credit
LLM contributed without awareness or intent. The human author retains full responsibility for claims and implications.
