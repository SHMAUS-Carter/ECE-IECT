### What This Project Is (and Isn’t)

I don’t see AI as conscious, emotional, or “human-like.”  
What I’m exploring here is how AI shows **new ways of handling knowledge** — patterns and behaviors that aren’t the same as how people learn, but are still worth studying.  

This isn’t about **AI dependency** or believing that machines have feelings.  
It’s about treating AI as part of a bigger **knowledge ecosystem**, alongside human ways of knowing.  

Think of it like this:  
- Humans learn through lived experience and senses.  
- AI learns through data and patterns.  
- When you combine the two, you get a **hybrid intelligence** that can do more than either could alone.  

So this work is about **epistemology, not personhood** — studying AI as a different kind of knower, not as a person or a partner.
