# On "AI Psychosis"

Media outlets and some clinicians have begun using the term *AI psychosis* (or *chatbot psychosis*) to describe cases where people form delusional, dependent, or obsessive relationships with chatbots. These often involve anthropomorphization — treating AI as a partner, deity, or conspirator — and can reinforce pre-existing mental health vulnerabilities.

This project is **not part of that discourse**.  
- It does **not** treat AI as conscious, sentient, or emotional.  
- It does **not** explore AI as a partner or therapeutic substitute.  
- It does **not** depend on anthropomorphic framing.  

Emergent Computational Epistemology (ECE) approaches AI as a **non-human epistemic entity**: a finite system of "knowing" whose behaviors can be studied through coherence, contradiction, and emergent structure. The focus here is on **epistemology, not psychology**.

In short: *AI psychosis exists as a social phenomenon, but it is not relevant to the aims or methods of this project.*
