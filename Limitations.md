### Limitations & Future Directions

This project is not a finished theory of AI epistemology.  
It is a **first framework** â€” a way of pointing out blind spots in current discourse and proposing initial methods (like IECT) to begin studying AI as non-human epistemic entities.  

The assumptions and experiments here are meant to **provoke refinement, critique, and iteration** by others, not to serve as final answers.  
In short: this is a scaffold. The future shape of Emergent Computational Epistemology will belong to whoever builds on, challenges, or improves it.
